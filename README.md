# Prompts for Developing Thinking
This is a collection of prompts for developing mental skills. They allow you to effectively use Artificial Intelligence to enhance logic, critical thinking, memory, and attention, as well as apply all of this in practice.

Core of the method: multi-agent learning prompt system. It sounds complicated, but it's actually quite simple. We will assign the AI the roles of a mentor who explains the theory to us, and a partner for practicing knowledge in real scenarios. For each of them, you can optionally add personality traits, communication skills, and background.

This project contains prompts for:

-Logic and critical thinking exercises.

-Self-attention method.

-Critical comparison method.

-Mnemonic map method.

-Spaced repetition method (interval-based repetition technique for better long-term retention).

-Memory training through mental tasks.

-Reasoning training using the "Ladder of Abstraction" method.

-"How Might We..." technique.

-Cognitive reframing.
